# Svelte UI components for Vercel examples

## Contributing

If you want to make an update to the package, go to an example and install it with npm:

```bash
npm i ../../packages/ui-svelte
```

npm will add a symlink and making changes to `packages/ui-svelte` will reload the app, once you're done feel free to create a PR!

> Make sure to have dependencies installed in `packages/ui-svelte` with `npm i` or otherwise the symlink won't resolve imports
